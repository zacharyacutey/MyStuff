Pure blank canvases always bring me joy
A sky waiting to be sprinkled  with stars
Like the innocent eyes of a young boy
Or a field stretching unreachably far
Valant adventures anxious to be had
Poems and songs screaming to be released
Happy or fearful, nostalgic or sad
Creativity should never be ceased
The world itself is you own blank canvas
To write or paint your own unique story
To believe that it's wired against us
Is useless and unbearably boring
Although I know it's difficult to see
Your canvas is just what you want it to be
