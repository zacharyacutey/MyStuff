To be a teacher: You have to teach
To teach: One has to impart knowledge
To impart knowledge: One gives knowledge
One cannot give what one already has ...  

If one knows beforehand ...
Yeah...
The teachers feel useless:
But one teacher wants to teach an AP Bio course, not enough enrollments, not enough students who know...
(
To the teacher on line 9, if you see this:
You seem to be able to teach more... I want there to exist an Honors teacher that
TEACHES NEW MATERIAL.
THANK YOU FOR THE BEST YEAR EVER!
You were the best teacher I've ever had where they taught me something new, and
for the student you talked about who passed the pretest.
We're never given one in math
