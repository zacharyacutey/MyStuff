To be a teacher: You have to teach
To teach: One has to impart knowledge
To impart knowledge: One gives knowledge
One cannot give what one already has ...  

If one knows beforehand ...
Yeah...
The teachers feel useless:
But one teacher wants to teach an AP Bio course, not enough enrollments, not enough students who know...
I want to cause many to feel useless, and one to fulfill a dream...
