To be a teacher: You have to teach
To teach: One has to impart knowledge
To impart knowledge: One gives knowledge
One cannot give what one already has ...  

If one knows beforehand ...
Yeah...
The teachers feel useless.

(If you are a certain teacher)

I would never make you feel useless.
Thank you for the best year ever!
